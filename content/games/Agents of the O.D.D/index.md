## Official Blurb

Agents of the O.D.D. is a tabletop roleplaying game of conscripted cryptids, shaky psychics, burned spies, and other investigators of the paranormal.

- 100 unique (and 80% weird) agent profiles
- 20 arcana
- 1 sample mission chock full of cryptids from lumberjack folklore
- New rules for advancement and equipment requisitions
- Advice for players and referees
